# 🐛 Bug Fix - Phase 3 Error

**Date**: October 19, 2025  
**Issue**: Server/Client Component Boundary Error

---

## ❌ Error

```
⨯ Error: Event handlers cannot be passed to Client Component props.
  <button onClick={function onClick} className=... children=...>
                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you need interactivity, consider converting part of this to a Client Component.
```

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

The `not-found.tsx` file was a Server Component by default, but it contained a button with an `onClick` event handler:

```tsx
<button
  onClick={() => window.history.back()}
  className="..."
>
  <ArrowLeft className="h-4 w-4" />
  <span>Go Back</span>
</button>
```

In Next.js 13+, Server Components cannot have event handlers. They need to be Client Components.

---

## ✅ Fix Applied

Added `'use client'` directive at the top of the file:

**File**: `src/app/not-found.tsx`

```tsx
'use client';

import Link from 'next/link';
import { Home, Search, ArrowLeft } from 'lucide-react';

export default function NotFound() {
  // ... rest of component
}
```

## 📝 Why This Happened

When I created the 404 page in Phase 3, I included interactive elements (the "Go Back" button with `onClick`) but forgot to mark it as a Client Component. Next.js defaults to Server Components, which cannot have client-side interactivity.

---

## ✅ Resolution

- **Status**: FIXED ✅
- **Files Modified**: 1 (`src/app/not-found.tsx`)
- **Change**: Added `'use client'` directive
- **Impact**: None - page still works the same, now without errors

---

## 🧪 Testing

After this fix, the error should disappear and:
- ✅ 404 page loads without errors
- ✅ "Go Back" button works correctly
- ✅ All other buttons work
- ✅ No console errors

---

## 📚 Lesson Learned

**Rule**: Any component with event handlers (`onClick`, `onChange`, etc.) or browser APIs (`window`, `document`) must be a Client Component with `'use client'` directive.

**Server Components** (default):
- ✅ Can fetch data directly
- ✅ Can use async/await
- ✅ Smaller bundle size
- ❌ No event handlers
- ❌ No browser APIs
- ❌ No useState/useEffect

**Client Components** (`'use client'`):
- ✅ Event handlers
- ✅ Browser APIs
- ✅ React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- ✅ Interactivity
- ❌ Larger bundle size
- ❌ Cannot directly fetch on server
