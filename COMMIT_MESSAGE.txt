## Testing

- ✅ TypeScript compilation: npx tsc --noEmit (0 errors)
- ✅ Production build: npm run build (successful)
- ✅ Dev server: npm run dev (running)
- ✅ All new API endpoints tested
- ✅ UI interactions verified

## Impact

### Before (v2.1.0)
- Users could create and view group posts
- Basic moderation (pin, delete)
- No social engagement features

### After (v2.2.0)
- Full social engagement (likes, comments, editing)
- Real-time UI updates
- Complete feature parity with social posts
- Production-ready group posts system

## Database Changes

No schema changes required - all tables already existed:
- group_posts (includes likesCount, commentsCount)
- group_post_comments (ready for use)
- group_post_likes (ready for use)

Tables were created in previous migrations but APIs were incomplete.

## Breaking Changes

None - All changes are backwards compatible additions.
