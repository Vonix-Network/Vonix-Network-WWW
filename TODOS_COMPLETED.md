- `src/components/error-boundary.tsx` - Added error tracking integration

### Features
- **Structured Logging** - Consistent error logging across the app
- **Context Support** - Attach user info, tags, and extra data to errors
- **Sentry Ready** - Automatically uses Sentry if `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` is set
- **Development Friendly** - Console logging in development mode
- **Production API** - Sends errors to `/api/errors` endpoint in production

### Usage Example
```typescript
import { captureException, captureMessage } from '@/lib/error-tracking';

try {
  // Your code
} catch (error) {
  captureException(error, {
    user: { id: userId, username },
    tags: { feature: 'social_posts' },
    extra: { postId: 123 }
  });
}
```

## 2. ‚úÖ Like Status Persistence

### What Was Done
- Implemented database-backed like status for comments
- Users' like status is now persisted and loaded from the database
- Fixed the TODO in `comment-card.tsx`

### Files Created
- `src/app/api/social/comments/[id]/like/status/route.ts` - API endpoint to check like status

### Files Modified
- `src/components/social/comment-card.tsx` - Added like status fetching from database

### Features
- **Persistent Likes** - Like status saved to `socialCommentLikes` table
- **Real-time Loading** - Fetches user's like status on component mount
- **Optimistic Updates** - Instant UI feedback with rollback on error
- **Session Aware** - Only fetches for logged-in users

### Database Table Used
```sql
social_comment_likes (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  comment_id INTEGER REFERENCES social_comments(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP
)
```

## 3. ‚úÖ Trending Algorithm & Popular Sorting

### What Was Done
- Added engagement metrics to social posts
- Implemented trending algorithm based on engagement and recency
- Implemented popular sorting by likes count
- Created database migration script

### Files Created
- `src/db/add-post-counts.ts` - Migration script to add engagement fields

### Files Modified
- `src/db/schema.ts` - Added `likesCount` and `commentsCount` to social posts
- `src/app/api/social/posts/route.ts` - Implemented trending and popular sorting

### Features

#### Trending Algorithm
```
Score = (likes + comments * 2) / (age_in_hours + 2)
```
- Comments weighted 2x more than likes
- Newer posts rank higher
- Prevents division by zero with +2 offset

#### Popular Sorting
- Sorts by `likesCount` descending
- Falls back to `createdAt` for ties

#### Sort Options
- `?sortBy=recent` - Latest posts first (default)
- `?sortBy=popular` - Most liked posts first
- `?sortBy=trending` - Trending algorithm

### Migration Required
Run this command to add the new fields:
```bash
npm run db:add-post-counts
```

Or manually:
```bash
tsx src/db/add-post-counts.ts
```

## 4. ‚úÖ Events UI Pages

### What Was Done
- Created complete events UI with listing and detail pages
- Implemented RSVP functionality with going/interested/not going status
- Full integration with existing events API

### Files Created

- `src/app/(public)/events/[id]/page.tsx` - Event detail page
- `src/components/events/event-rsvp-button.tsx` - RSVP button component

### Features

#### Events Listing Page (`/events`)

## 5. ‚úÖ Ranks Button Text Fix

### What Was Done
- Fixed invisible button text when background and text colors match
- Button now always uses white text for visibility

### Files Modified

### Before
```tsx
style={{
  backgroundColor: rank.color,
  color: rank.textColor, // Could match background!

```tsx
style={{
  backgroundColor: rank.color,
  color: '#ffffff', // Always visible

## üìä Impact Summary

### User Experience Improvements
1. **Better Error Handling** - Errors are now tracked and can be monitored
2. **Persistent Likes** - Users' likes are saved across sessions
3. **Smarter Content Discovery** - Trending and popular sorting helps surface best content
4. **Events Feature** - Users can now browse and RSVP to community events
5. **Visual Fixes** - Ranks buttons are always readable

### Developer Experience Improvements
1. **Error Tracking** - Easy to integrate Sentry for production monitoring
2. **Clean Code** - All TODOs in codebase resolved
3. **Database Migrations** - Proper migration scripts for schema changes
4. **Type Safety** - All new code is fully typed with TypeScript

### Technical Debt Reduction
- Removed 8 TODO comments from codebase
- Implemented 4 missing features
- Fixed 1 visual bug
- Added 6 new files with proper structure
- Created migration scripts for database changes

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Run Database Migrations** (if not already done)
   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate-all
   ```
   
   This will run all migrations including the new post counts migration. The migration is idempotent, so it's safe to run multiple times.

2. **Optional: Configure Sentry**
   ```bash
   # Add to .env.local
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn
   ```

### Recommended Follow-ups
1. **Blog Rich Text Editor** - Add WYSIWYG editor for blog posts
2. **Forum Permissions UI** - Create admin interface for category permissions
3. **Unit Tests** - Add tests for new features
4. **Performance Testing** - Test trending algorithm with large datasets

## üìù Notes

### Breaking Changes
- **None** - All changes are backward compatible

### Database Changes
- Added `likes_count` column to `social_posts`
- Added `comments_count` column to `social_posts`
- Migration script provided to update existing data

### API Changes
- **New Endpoint**: `GET /api/social/comments/[id]/like/status`
- **Enhanced**: `GET /api/social/posts` now supports `sortBy` parameter

### Environment Variables
- **Optional**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` - For Sentry error tracking
